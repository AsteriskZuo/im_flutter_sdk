# Agora Chat SDK Project Introduction
1. Developed using a federated plugin approach, supporting both Android and iOS platforms.
2. The SDK README is available at [README](agora_chat_sdk/README.md).

## Package version

The current release is `1.4.0+1`. The four Dart packages (`agora_chat_sdk`, `agora_chat_sdk_interface`, `agora_chat_sdk_android`, and `agora_chat_sdk_ios`) and the iOS podspec use this version.

`1.4.0+1` is a valid Dart/Flutter package version: `1.4.0` is the base version and `+1` is build metadata. It is a stable version. Pub includes build metadata in version ordering, so `1.4.0 < 1.4.0+1 < 1.4.1`; a dependency on `^1.4.1` does not accept this release. CocoaPods also accepts the `1.4.0+1` podspec version.

To select this exact release, use `agora_chat_sdk: 1.4.0+1`; use `agora_chat_sdk: ^1.4.0+1` to allow later compatible versions below `2.0.0`.
